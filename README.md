# Hi, I'm Daniel Amekpoagbe

Frontend developer from Tema, Ghana building engaging web experiences with React and modern JavaScript. Currently working on Knowly and continuously exploring new tools and patterns in web development.

## What I'm up to

Right now I'm diving into TanStack Router, TypeScript, and GraphQL to level up my backend integration skills. I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and creating interfaces that feel good to use.

## Let's talk about

If you want to chat about React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, or Firebase, I'm here for it. I'm always keen to discuss best practices, architecture patterns, or just debug some weird JavaScript behavior together.

## Tech stack

I work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, GraphQL, Supabase, Firebase, Vite, and Git.
