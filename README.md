**Daniel Amekpoagbe**  
Frontend Engineer • Accra, Ghana

I build fast, accessible, and delightful web experiences that solve real problems.

Right now I’m focused on **Builderr** — a no-code, section-based portfolio builder that lets designers, freelancers, and creators assemble and deploy a professional portfolio in minutes, without writing a single line of code.  
It removes the biggest friction point most non-technical talent face: “I have great work, but I don’t have a portfolio site.” Builderr gives them a clean, modern, fully customizable site with one-click deployment.

### What I bring to the table
- Deep expertise in **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript** — I ship production-grade, type-safe, performant applications daily.
- Mastery of **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, consistent, and maintainable styling.
- Strong foundation in modern frontend architecture (TanStack Router, GraphQL, server components, edge rendering).
- Obsession with clean code, performance, accessibility, and pixel-perfect interfaces that users actually enjoy.

Whether it’s turning complex product requirements into intuitive UIs or building tools that empower other creators, I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of great design and reliable engineering.
