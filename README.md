**DANIEL AMEKPOAGBE YAWSON**  
Loc: Frontend Engineer • Accra, Ghana

I build fast, accessible, and delightful web experiences that solve real problems.

Currently building **[Builderr](https://www/builderr.site)** — a no-code, section-based portfolio builder that lets designers, freelancers, and creators launch a clean, professional site in minutes without writing any code.

### What I bring to the table
- Deep expertise in **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript** — shipping production-grade, type-safe, performant apps daily
- Mastery of **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, consistent, and maintainable styling
- Strong foundation in modern frontend architecture (TanStack Router, React Query, GraphQL, Redux, Server Components, Edge Rendering)
- Obsessed with clean code, performance, accessibility, and interfaces people actually enjoy using

I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of great design and reliable engineering.

Always learning. Always shipping.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually watching stand-up comedy or football ⚽  
(And yes — I still think JavaScript is both chaotic and beautiful.)
